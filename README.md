# Description

This fun app was built for the [Code in Place 2021](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/2021/showcase/361) final project. I built the app using TKinter.
It is my first application built since I started programming. This project made me discover the power of the Python language. 
The project has access to a database with the 8 largest cryptocurrency's values since 2016. It takes the date you choose, the amount you invested and returns the value
you would have on the 4/20/21.
